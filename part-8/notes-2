Handling Traffic with Ingress Controllers

Load Balancing Service Object
	- Legacy way of getting network traffic into a cluster
	- Ingress service --> newer and better

	- Doesnt allow multiple connections to the outside, only allows connections to one set of pods

	- Will be using ingress service

Ingresses
	- Exposes a set of services to the outside world
	- Will be using Nginx Ingress

	*********************************************************
	- We are using "ingress-nginx" the community led project
		- not using "kubernetes-ingress", a project led by the company nginx
	*********************************************************
	- Note:
		- setup of ingress-nginx changes depending on your env (local, GC, AWS, Azure)


	- We must create the config file, so it can make an ingress controller that accepts incoming traffic

	- On the Cloud:
		- create config
			- deployment has nginx pod
			- Google cloud creates a GC load balancer
				- also creates a LoadBalancer Service within the node

Enable Minikube Ingress Service
	- " minikube addons enable ingress "


To see if ingress worked locally:
	- Go to minikube's ip address to see if things got mapped
	-NOT HTTPS********
	- ingress-nginx does not set up HTTPS on its own

Minikube Dashboard
	- " minikube dashboard "
