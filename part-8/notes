Multi Container App with K8s

One seperate config files for all Objects within the node
	- 1 ingress service
	- 4 ClusterIP Services
		- Multi-Client pod * 3
		- Multi-Server pod * 3
		- multi-worker pod
		- Redis pod
		- Postgres pod

ClusterIP vs NodePort Services
	- ClusterIP: exposes a set of pods to other objects in the cluster
		- doesnt allow traffic to come in from the outside world*********************************************
		- need to make use of Ingress Service
	- NodePort: Exposes a set of pods to the outside world (only good for dev purpose)

Combining Config Into Single Files
	- can combine different sets of config into a sinlge file
	- just make sure to include three dashes "---" in between objects


Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
	- link the hard drive of the host machine with the container drive

	- why do we need PVC
		- its saves data
		- if pod crashes, for instance, a postgres DB pod crashes... the data within the db will be lost. Therefore, we need to save that data onto the host machine's drive
		- The data should be saved to the "volume" on host machine

Kubernetes Volumes
	- **** An OBJECT that allows a container to store data at the pod level
		- it is not exactly the same as a Docker volume
	- there are also Persistent Volume Claim + Persistent Volume


Volumes vs Persistent Volumes
	- Volume would be long term storage within pod. If container crashes the volume still exists. BUT if pod crashes, everything inside the volume goes away
	- Persistent Volume is a long term storage outside of the pod. If pod crashes, the volume still exists

Persistent Volumes vs Persistent Volume Claims
	- persistent volume (PV) is the "physical" volume on the host machine that stores your persistent data. A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request for the platform to create a PV for you, and you attach PVs to your pods via a PVC.


PersistentVolumeClaim Object
	- "accessModes" has three modes
		- ReadWriteOnce
			- Can be used by a single node
		-ReadOnlyMany
			- multiple nodes can read from this
		-ReadWriteMany
			- Can be read and written to by many nodes

Where does k8s Allocate Persistent Volumes?
	- k8s will make storage from your local machine
	- "kubectl get storageclass"
	- " kubectl describe storageclass "
	- things change when you take the app to the cloud

Designating a PVC in a pod template
	- once you make your PVC config:
		- add a "volumes" type to the spec of the deployment template
		- map the pvc to the container
