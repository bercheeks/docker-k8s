Why docker?
	- Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies

Image
	- Single file with all the deps and config required to run a program
Container
	- Instance of an image. Runs a program

login to docker hub
	- "docker login"

Docker Client
	- "docker run hello-world"
		- Docker server sees if local image cache contains the hello-world image.
			- since it doesn't, it checks Docker Hub which is an online repo


What's Really a Container?
	- Image really means = File System Snapshot
	- Container is a image of a process (e.g. ubuntu), with a kernel, and all of the running hardware needed for the container(hard drive, network, RAM, CPU)
