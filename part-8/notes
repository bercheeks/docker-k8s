Multi Container App with K8s

One seperate config files for all Objects within the node
	- 1 ingress service
	- 4 ClusterIP Services
		- Multi-Client pod * 3
		- Multi-Server pod * 3
		- multi-worker pod
		- Redis pod
		- Postgres pod

ClusterIP vs NodePort Services
	- ClusterIP: exposes a set of pods to other objects in the cluster
		- doesnt allow traffic to come in from the outside world*********************************************
		- need to make use of Ingress Service
	- NodePort: Exposes a set of pods to the outside world (only good for dev purpose)

Combining Config Into Single Files
	- can combine different sets of config into a sinlge file
	- just make sure to include three dashes "---" in between objects
