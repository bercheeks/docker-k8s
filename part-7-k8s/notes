Onwards to Kubernetes

What is k8s?
	- System for running many different containers over multiple different machines

Why is k8s?
	- When you need to run many different containers with different images


Working with Kubernetes
	- Development vs Production:
		- Dev: minikube
		- Prod: EKS or GKE

	minikube (local env only)
		- used for managing the VM itself
	kubectl (will use in the cloud as well)
		- used for managing containers in the node


minikube start/status
	-"minikube start"
		- starts service
	-"minikube status"
		- make sure "apiserver" is running


Kubernetes expects all images to already be built
	-make sure our images is hosted on docker hub
Make one config file to create the container
Make one config file to set up networking


Push images to docker hub
	- login through docker hub = " docker login "
	- " docker push bercheeky/multi-nginx "


k8s yaml files terminology
	****************************************************
	- Node = Virtual machine
	- Pods = are the smallest unit we can deploy in k8s 
	****************************************************
	- Containers dont run in k8s
		- pods run instead... basically containers
		- containers are inside the pod
	- Objects******************
		- Objects serve different purposes
			- running a container, monitoring a container, setting up networking, etc

		- Config files are used to create these 'Objects'
		- Object types:
			-statefulSet
			- ReplicaController
			- Pod
				- used to run a container
				- a pod runs inside a node
					- this pod may contain a nginx container
				- can have multiple containers within it, but they must have a very strong dependency for one another
			- Service
				- sets up networking in a k8s cluster
				-Subtypes:
					ClusterIP
					NodePort -> exposes port to the outside
						- only for dev purposes
					Load Balancer
					Ingress


	- apiVersion: v1 ||| or ||| apiVersion: apps/v1


	Connecting to running Containers
		- " kubectl apply -f <filename> "
			- apply = change current config of our cluster
			- -f specifies the config file
	see status of pods
		- " kubectl get pods "
	see services
		- " kubectl get services "

	Once you start a pod, it will be localhost. IP address will be assigned by Minikube
		-" minikube ip " gets the ip address

	*************
	Make sure "kind type is capitalized" pod = Pod

As devs, we work with the master node(api server) when interacting with kubernetes

To deploy something, we update the desired state of the master with a config file
The master works to meet your desired state
