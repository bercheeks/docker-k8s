Making Real Projects with Docker

Project outline
	- tiny node js website, wrapped in a docker container
	- and bootable on local machine

	- Create Node JS web app
	- Create Dockerfile
	- Build image from Dockerfile
	- Run image as container
	- Connect to web app from a browser

- Errors to keep in mind
	- basic images, such as 'alpine' do not have much programs included with it
	FROM node:14-alpine
		- alpine OS with node already included


	-No local files are included in container's hard drive, you must specify this part
		- COPY ./<path to folder on local machine> ./<folder in container>
		- COPY ./ ./



	Container Port Mapping
		- the container has its own set of isolated ports, that it can receive traffic from
		- must port map from local machine to container
			- runtime constraint

			- " docker run -p 8080:8080 <image name> " ****************
				- first port: route incoming requests to this port on local host to... 
				- second port: ...this port inside the container
				- these two ports do not have to match

	Specifying a Working Directory
		WORKDIR
			- Specifies where the starting directory for the docker container is
			- Creates the container if it does not exist
			" WORKDIR /usr/app "
