Manipulating Containers with Docker Client

	Overriding Default Commands
		- "docker run busybox echo hi there"
		- "docker run busybox ls"
			- prints directory of the container

	List all previous ran containers:
		- " docker --all "

	docker run = docker create + docker start
		- " docker create hello-world "
		- " docker start -a <hash> "
			- 'a' flag watches out for output from the container 


	Restarting stopped containers
		- " docker start -a <hash> "

	Removing Stopped Containers
		- " docker system prune "


	Retrieving Log Outputs
		- "docker logs <container id>"
			- prints out all logs that are emitted from the container

	Stopping Containers
		- "docker stop <container>" ***recommended
			-SIGTERM
			-Cleans up while shutting down
		- " docker kill "
			- SIGKILL
			- shut down right now


	Multi-Command Containers
	 -Executing Commands in Running Containers
	 	- " docker exec -it <container id> <command> "
	 		- '-it' allows us to provide input to the container *****

	-"-it" flag ****


	Getting a Command Prompt in a Container
		- instead of always running docker exec
		- " docker exec -it <container id> sh "
			- gets a shell

			-'sh' is a command processor. Like bash


	Start with a shell
		- " docker run -it busybox sh "
