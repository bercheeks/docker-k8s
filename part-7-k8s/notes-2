Maintaining Sets of Containers With Deployments

Updating a Container with k8s
	- just update the yaml config file:
		- " kubectl apply -f <file> "

Get Detailed info about an object:
	- " kubectl describe <object type> <object name> "
	OR
	- " kubectl describe <object type> "
		- omits the name one

		kubectl describe pod client-pod

Running Containers with Deployments
	- with type pod: you can update image fields but not stuff like containers, name, or port.
	- use type/kind Deployment object
	-Deployment:
		- maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number exists
	Deployment > Pods
		- pods run single set of containers vs Deployment runs a set of identical pods (one or more)
		- Deployment is good for production
